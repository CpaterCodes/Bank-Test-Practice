#Test Exercise: Command line banking app#

In order to better practice both my solo development skills and for any
tech tests I will have to undergo in applying to a position, I am attempting to
build a simple simulation of a bank that fulfils the following user stories:

```

As a user
Who wants to track their money
I would like an account with a bank wherein I can see my balance
(Status: passing tests)

As a user
So that I can store money
I would like to be able to deposit it into a bank account
(status: passing tests)

As a user
So that I can later take money out to spend
I would like to be able to be able to later withdraw from said bank account
(status: building tests)

As a user
So that I can keep track of all such activities and be alerted to fraud
I would like to be able to see the date/amount of all activities
(status: building tests)

As a user
As if it really needs saying at this point
I would like this to be saved in memory somehow
(status: building tests)
```
